I started using social media quite recently.

I always thought it was a total time waste and couldn't be bothered to try. Finally, I gave it a go on a day like this last February (2023). Marking my first year, I'm gonna share my opinions about social media and the impact it had on me.

My first try was with Twitter (aka X). It's definitely a solid social media experience with a ton of great memes! I absolutely love it (no meatriding intended). I spend around 30 minutes daily on X. Sometimes more.

However, it didn't have much influence on me because there weren't any of my friends. Basically, it just taught me to be more humourous and create pretty dumb memes (follow me for dumb programming memes :)... I barely have 15 followers though. Still, you know, it's what it is.

Then came Instagram. Ha, that hit me different. Yo, there was a bunch of my homies. It caused me some dramatic mindset shifts, especially by seeing all the cool stuff they did. For instance, I would never post a photograph of me online. Instagram just flipped it. Now, I can hit that post button without a second thought.

Not to mention, it became a pretty good way to drive the bros crazy using my dumb memes. Finally, I gave up Instagram last month because I realised it was getting out of hand. I'm glad I did that...

From my experience, I can say that social media is the best way to keep up with cool stuff in the world. Excessive usage can cause destruction. Of course, all you need is some self-control and a cool app distraction-free app to get the best out of it.

Anyway, I know this was a relatively short article (compared to my other ones). I thought it'd be nice to share my experience with social media. Let me know if you like it. I'll catch you in another one!
