Ever since I started using a computer, Chrome has been my go-to browser. Well, it was only until I realised Chrome was eating up most of my memory and tracking all my browsing history to display ads.

:(

So, I researched and finally switched to Brave. No doubt, it's been an absolute game-changer.

As I have been using Brave for quite a while, I thought of sharing my experience with you in this article. That way, you can even make a wise decision about your browser.

### Why Brave?

My first choice was to switch to Mozilla Firefox since it was open-source. Once I started using it, I realised it doesn't support all the extensions I used in Chrome. That was where Brave kicked in.

Coincidentally, the same guy had founded Brave, Mozilla Firefox and most importantly, JavaScript (the heart of modern websites): Brendan Eich

![Brendan Eich - Wikipedia](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1702630539936/c299d549-8595-4e6b-b95d-fb4b7368f0bf.jpeg?width=512 align="center")

In a gist, these were the core Brave features that attracted me over Chrome or Firefox;

* Brave is fully open-source, unlike Chrome (you can find its source code: [here](https://github.com/brave)).
    
* Both Brave and Chrome share the same foundation: Chromium (an open-source web project developed and maintained by Google)
    
    * This means that any extension available on Chrome is available on Brave.
        
* Brave blocks trackers and ads out of the box (no need for third-party extensions like in other browsers)
    
    * Not to mention, Chrome even uses your data to display more customised ads.
        

Undoubtedly, Brave is a clear win!

### The Transition

The transition from Chrome to Brave was *smooth*; more smoother than transitioning to Firefox. With one click, I could import all my browsing history, extensions and bookmarks from Chrome.

To be frank, I can't even tell that I am using Brave without looking at the logo. Brave is almost Chrome-like.

If there's a browser that can knock Chrome out of its throne, that's Brave.

### Additional Features of Brave

* Since Brave has ad and tracker blockers, it has faster page loading speeds. However, in terms of performance, Chrome and Brave are pretty much the same (that's because it depends on a variety of external factors such as your internet speed). Nevertheless, Brave uses slightly less memory than Chrome, on average.
    
* Brave has a built-in gateway to the Tor network
    
    <div data-node-type="callout">
    <div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
    <div data-node-type="callout-text">Tor is a decentralised network which allows anonymous communication over the internet. This is why it is so infamous for cyber criminal activities.</div>
    </div>
    
* Brave has an AI copilot to enhance your browsing experience. It can summarise articles and answer your spontaneous questions on the spot.
    
* Brave has a ton of Web3 functionality such as built-in crypto wallets.
    

Frankly, I didn't find any feature that Chrome has but Brave doesn't.

### Conclusion

All in all, if you are using any other browser, I highly recommend you to try Brave. With all its fancy features, you will definitely fall in love with it thanks to the freedom it brings to you for *free*. No trackers. No ads. Ever.

Anyway, stay ***Brave*** until I catch you in another article.
