See, YouTube has become so annoying with this adblocker war. It just pops up these absurd threats and drives people crazy.

Good News! There's a simple trick you can do to bypass all of YouTube's ad-blockers blockers once and for all.

### üîÆ The Trick

1. Go over to your preferred Web Store and download the TamperMonkey extension (this is a fully open-source extension)
    
    * On [Chrome/Brave](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
        
    * On [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)
        
    * On [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
        
    * On [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)
        
2. Then head over to GreasyFork and install this [User Script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/459541-youtube%E5%8E%BB%E5%B9%BF%E5%91%8A-youtube-ad-blocker)

3. üéâ Enjoy

<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üí°</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong>Important: </strong>You should add YouTube.com to your ad blocker's filter list (if you have one)</div>
</div>

### ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

What you just installed is a JavaScript script that runs every time you load a YouTube video. As far as I'm concerned, it automatically skips YouTube ads instead of blocking them. This is why YouTube can't identify it. So, it can't throw out those annoying threats.

However, this means that you will sometimes see the ad for a split second before the script gets executed. In the longer run, it isn't much of a deal, though.

### üóíÔ∏è Side Note

Not to mention, most ad blockers (e.g. uBlock Origin) are constantly being updated to avoid these pop-ups. Similarly, YouTube even updates its ad-blocker blockers to annihilate them. So, it's sort of a war. This user script can be considered as a dude who doesn't participate in the ad blocker war... Nice!

### üëã Conclusion

Congrats! By now, you can use YouTube free of ads. However, if you can, please support YouTube by buying their premium subscription. See, it takes a lot of effort and storage to deploy a video-sharing platform that is used by billions of people.

Have a happy ad-free YouTube experience till I catch you in another article!
