Frankly, creating a product is hard. Launching a product is harder. When you mess up the launch, you end up wasting all the effort you put in and ultimately, getting frustrated.

As always, by following a strategy you can avoid this and make the most out of your precious effort. That's exactly what I'm gonna share with you in this article...

**The Golden Rule**

> *"Create a product and offer it in such a way that it becomes irresistible for the consumers not to pay attention!"*

### üèóÔ∏è Building an Audience

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1705740869979/b4787dd6-6ae0-4edc-a4bd-accb681bc5a4.jpeg?height=512 align="center")

If you don't have an audience, there'll be no one to sell a product to.

So, the first thing you should do is try your best to grow an audience on your social media accounts especially if you don't have enough money to spend on advertisements.

Indeed, it's far easier said than done. Still, there's a simple strategy you can follow to quickly do so!

See, everyone undergoes the same hardship when growing on social media. As a result, most users have started following whoever follows them. It's sort of like helping each other.

By using this, I was able to gain more than 100 followers within a month, starting with 0 followers! So, you can trust me on that.

You can start by following different people. Especially, look for people whose "following" count is far greater than the "follower" count. That means they are even following the same strategy. So, there's a higher chance their followers will follow you if you follow them.

By the way, make sure you focus more on Product Hunt because that's a popular product-launching platform. If you can gain a considerable number of followers, no doubt, there's a higher chance of your launch being successful!

It will be completely free and open source. Hopefully, I'll have launched it by April 2024. You can follow me on X (formerly known as Twitter) to get more updates on that! Plus, I'll write an article about it, once it's finished :)</div>

### üì¶ Create a Sick Product

Now, say you have gathered a huge audience. Still, no one would use your product if it's not worth it!

That's why this is the most important phase of the whole process. The quality of your product determines everything!

To create a successful product, you need to solve a problem through your product. You should research and analyse whether the problem is painful enough for the consumers to use your product.

In fact, the problem you solve and the solution you provide via your product is the backbone when it comes to marketing it!

To make sure you are on the right track, ask for opinions from your audience through polls or quizzes. That's even a good way to interact more with your audience and keep up your follower count.

Here's the summary,

1. Find an idea
    
2. Research if it's going to solve a problem that's painful enough for the consumer
    
3. Execute the idea

### üì¢ Market Your Product

**The Golden Rule**: Never launch your product immediately after finishing it! Instead, you must create a conversation around your product, attract people and capture their interest!

If you need some real-world examples,

* Apple Vision Pro was first announced on 5th June 2023. But it was only released almost 8 months later: 2nd February 2024.
    
* Tesla Cybertruck had a 4-year gap between its announcement and release ü§Ø!
    

However, you shouldn't leave a large time gap especially if you are just starting. 3 to 4 months is a sufficient time gap!

During this time gap, you should be posting content that revolves around your product. Here's a fancy strategy to follow:

1. Make the consumers aware of the problem and emphasise how much pain and loss it causes them.
    
2. Present solutions to that problem. Then, insist that your product is the best at providing those solutions! You can show some previews of your product to validate your claim!
    

You can choose which type of content you are going to post. Still, make sure to have a wide variety. Here are some examples:

* Tweets
    
* Blog Posts
    
* Podcasts
    
* Videos
    
* Posts on Instagram or Facebook
    

### üöÄ Launch the Product

Ha, finally, the most exciting part! If you have been keeping up with the marketing campaign we discussed above, you just have to announce your product is now available. Make sure to summarise the problem your product is trying to solve and how well it does so.

That way, people who haven't even engaged in the marketing campaign will be interested!

### ü•π Get Feedback & Improve

Every year, a more refined product gets released by pretty much every tech company. That's how they can sustain their brand identity and provide the best service possible!

You should do pretty much the same! For instance, you can address issues with your product and get user feedback to improve it further.

### üëã Conclusion

To sign off, let me leave you with a nice analogy.

*Your product is your child. By launching the product you are only giving birth to it. Afterwards, you have to feed it and make it grow. The more you love and care for it, the more it will yield!*

Along the way, have some fun raising your cute little product baby! All the best! ü§û
