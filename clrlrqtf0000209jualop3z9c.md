Frankly, creating a product is hard. Launching a product is harder. When you mess up the launch, you end up wasting all the effort you put in and ultimately, getting frustrated.

As always, by following a strategy you can avoid this and make the most out of your precious effort. That's exactly what I'm gonna share with you in this article...

**The Golden Rule**

> *"Create a product and offer it in such a way that it becomes irresistible for the consumers not to pay attention!"*

### üèóÔ∏è Building an Audience

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1705740869979/b4787dd6-6ae0-4edc-a4bd-accb681bc5a4.jpeg?height=512 align="center")

When I started, I barely had 10 followers on my social media accounts. So, every product I created ended up failing since not more than 10 people knew about it.

That made me realise that if I don‚Äôt have a large enough audience, there‚Äôll be no one to sell a product to.

So, the first thing you should do is try your best to grow an audience on your social media accounts, especially if you don‚Äôt have enough money to spend on advertisements.

Indeed, it‚Äôs far easier said than done. Still, there‚Äôs a simple strategy you can follow to quickly gain more followers!

See, everyone undergoes the same hardship when growing on social media. As a result, most users have started following whoever follows them. It‚Äôs sort of like helping each other.

By using this, I was able to gain more than 100 followers within a month, starting with around 6 followers! So, you can trust me on that.

Start by following different people. Especially, look for people whose ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù count is far greater than the ‚Äúfollower‚Äù count. That means they are even following the same strategy. So, there‚Äôs a higher chance their followers will follow you if you follow them. It‚Äôs also a good thing to consider the people you follow would be potentially interested in buying your product.

By the way, focus more on Product Hunt because that‚Äôs a popular product-launching platform. If you can gain a considerable number of followers Product Hunt, no doubt, there‚Äôs a higher chance your next launch will be successful!

It will be completely free and open source. Hopefully, I'll have launched it by April 2024. You can follow me on X (formerly known as Twitter) to get more updates on that!

### üì¶ Create a Sick Product

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1705740864395/a07f7473-7614-428b-95f7-d5a9e9815100.jpeg?height=512 align="center")

Now, say you have gathered a huge audience. Still, no one would use your product if it's not worth it!

That's why this is the most important phase of the whole process. The quality of your product determines everything!

To create a successful product, you need to solve a problem through your product. You should research and analyse whether the problem is painful enough for the consumers to use your product.

In fact, the problem you solve and the solution you provide via your product is the backbone when it comes to marketing it!

To make sure you are on the right track, ask for opinions from your audience through polls or quizzes. That's even a good way to interact more with your audience and keep up your follower count.

Here's the summary,

1. Find an idea
    
2. Research if it's going to solve a problem that's painful enough for the consumer
    
3. Execute the idea
    

> *"To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions."*

Speaking of my experience, here‚Äôs a breakdown of all the products I have *unsuccessfully* launched and the problem each product was trying to solve.

*Full disclosu*[*re:*](https://www.producthunt.com/products/studysphere) [*both of thes*](https://www.producthunt.com/products/link-orchard)*e products are free and open-source (the reasons are explained in the following paragraphs).*

I didn‚Äôt research befor[e creating a](https://www.producthunt.com/products/studysphere)n[y of these p](https://www.producthunt.com/products/link-orchard)roducts. I had no plan whatsoever to inform more people about them. Plus, there was already a saturated market [for Notion T](https://www.producthunt.com/products/link-orchard)[emplat](https://www.producthunt.com/products/studysphere)es and link-in-bio tools.

For instance, Link Orchard was not something 99% of people would be interested in. P[opular tools](https://www.producthunt.com/products/studysphere) such as Linktree had already acquired the market.

StudySphere[, on the oth](https://www.producthunt.com/products/link-orchard)er hand, was quite technical. You need Python and some other dependencies to set up the command-line interface it com[es with. Eve](https://www.producthunt.com/products/studysphere)n thoug[h the whole](https://www.producthunt.com/products/link-orchard) process would take only 15 minutes at most, it was pretty hard to market since it didn‚Äôt have a Graphical User Interf[ace.](https://www.producthunt.com/products/studysphere)

[*Well,*](https://www.producthunt.com/products/studysphere) *I could have implemented one, but I was too lazy* üòâ*‚Ä¶*

### üì¢ Market Your Product

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1705740924862/5d02d99a-58e1-47aa-a0a6-6b23821f72a1.jpeg?height=512 align="center")

**A Rule of Thumb**: Never launch your product immediately after finishing it! [Instead, yo](https://www.producthunt.com/products/link-orchard)u must create a conversation around your product, attract people and capture their interest!

If you need some real-w[orld example](https://www.producthunt.com/products/studysphere)s,

* Apple Vision Pro was first announced on 5th June 2023. But it was only released almost 8 months later: 2nd February 2024.
    
* Tesla Cybertruck had a 4-year gap between its announcement and release ü§Ø!
    

However, you shouldn't leave a large time gap especially if you are just starting. 3 to 4 months is a sufficient time gap!

During this time gap, you should be posting content that revolves around your product. Here's a fancy strategy to follow:

1. Make the consumers aware of the problem and emphasise how much pain and loss it causes them.
    
2. Present solutions to that problem. Then, insist that your product is the best at providing those solutions! You can show some previews of your product to validate your claim!
    

You can choose which type of content you are going to post. Still, make sure to have a wide variety. Here are some examples:

* Tweets
    
* Blog Posts
    
* Podcasts
    
* Videos
    
* Posts on Instagram or Facebook
    

I‚Äôm gonna be candid here¬†:)

When I first came across this marketing strategy, I was like, ‚ÄúHell NO!‚Äù. You see, it takes a lot of effort to create a product. How on earth can I wait longer to release it to the public? True, I could have been holding the marketing campaign while working on the project, but‚Ä¶ (*cough, cough*)

You should NOT be like me. So, please be a bit patient and execute this marketing strategy. It will definitely pay you off.

### üöÄ Launch the Product

Ha, finally, the most exciting part!

If you have been keeping up with the marketing campaign we discussed above, you just have to announce your product is now available. Make sure to summarise the problem your product is trying to solve and how well it does so. That way, people who haven‚Äôt even engaged in the marketing campaign will be interested!

<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üí°</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">By the way, it's important to offer a free version or trial of your product to allow customers to test it out before making a purchase.</div>
</div>

### ü•π Get Feedback & Improve

Every year, a more refined product gets released by pretty much every tech company. That's how they can sustain their brand identity and provide the best service possible!

You should do pretty much the same! For instance, you can address issues with your product and get user feedback to improve it further.

### üëã Conclusion

This is just a bird‚Äôs eye view of a product-launching strategy. I‚Äôm planning to write in-depth articles for each section. So, feel free to follow me on Hashnode!

To sign off, let me leave you with a nice analogy.

*Your product is your child. By launching the product you are only giving birth to it. Afterwards, you have to feed it and make it grow. The more you love and care for it, the more it will yield!*

Along the way, have some fun raising your cute little product baby! All the best! ü§û
