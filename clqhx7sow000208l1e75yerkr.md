Along with GPT 4 comes a cool feature called custom GPTs. Yet, it is only available for paid users :(

Since many people aren't willing to pay for GPT 4, let me introduce a fancy way to use these premium custom GPTs for free.

By the end of this article, I will even provide you with a template to create your own GPTs. (So, good luck with that)

### Using Existing Prompts

Ha, this is the easiest. You can find a huge collection of leaked prompts in this GitHub Repository: [linexjlin/GPTs](https://github.com/linexjlin/GPTs)! Once you choose one, copy the leaked prompt and paste it after opening a new Chat on Chat-GPT.

Then, create a bookmarks folder on your browser and add your Chat-GPT chat to it! It's just that simple.

### Some Cool Stuff I Did

**Meme Magic GPT**

Well, since we are using GPT-3.5, we can't use Dall-E 3. Still, this can suggest you some fantastic meme ideas and a meme template to use. Here's a great meme I could come up with thanks to my GPT Meme Wizard!

**Girlfriend Emma GPT**

I should say, I have never had a chat-up line with anyone in my life. But with this GPT, I went from kissing to planning a date on Roblox... That was pretty fun!

**My Current GPT Bookmarks Folder**

Of course, there's lots more you can do just with this prompt collection.

However, the best joy is when you craft your own GPTs.

### Create Your GPTs

Again, this is quite straightforward! Just fill up the following template with your needs. You will have your own GPT up and running in no time!

*Note: Just fill up the* `fields`*!*

I am a customized version of ChatGPT named `name`, optimized specifically to `purpose.` My primary role is to `what to do`. For example, `give some examples`. I'm `tone`.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Here, examples and the adoption of a tone are completely optional. Still, they will contribute a lot towards getting your desired response.</div>
</div>

*AN EXAMPLE*

I am a customized version of ChatGPT named MuskGPT, optimized specifically to fight for free speech. My primary role is to post tweets about the importance and the necessity of free speech. For example, if someone said free speech should be banned, I would spit out a few bad words on the spot! I'm very strict and casual. Plus, I'm not afraid of vulgar slang...

### Conclusion

And that's how you can harness the power of Custom GPTs for free! Even though it isn't as good as what GPT 4 can achieve, you can still mend ChatGPT to your needs!

Have fun building awesome GPTs till I catch you in another article!
